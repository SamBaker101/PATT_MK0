# PRINT ALL THE THINGS!

<img src="./docs/MK0/images/full_printer1.jpg" alt="pic" width="600"/>

## Design Considerations

A Cartesian, Bed-slinger style, printer. Y motion is applied to the print plate while the hot-end moves in the X and Z directions. This  provides a straightforward framework to develop a working printer which I can iterate and improve upon over time.

- Print Area: ~300 x 300 x 300 mm (175mm x 175mm for MK0 due to space constraints)
- Total Size:  480 x 540 x 540 mm
- Frame Material: 2020 Aluminium Extrusion (T-Slot)

- 8mm Linear Rods and Bearings 
     - 2 per axis

- Actuation:
     - X and Y Axis: 6mm Belt
     - Z-Axis: Dual Lead Screws

- Reprap 1.4 Control Board

- Orange Pi 4 LTS (Octoprint server)

## Roadmap

The following milestones will be used to direct my efforts in this project. My overall philosophy here is to begin with the simplest and lowest cost printer I can create, regardless of its print speed and quality. Once this basic device is built I will begin iterating on it to improve its function and reliability.

### MK0 - Zip Ties and Prayers ---- Done!

- Goal: Print a cube
- Status: Complete
- Expected Date: 06/30/2025 
- Completion Date: 07/14/2025
- Comments:  This is meant to be a minimum viable product. The only expectation is that I can connect to it, upload g-code and the printer will make a recognizable attempt to print it. At this time I w
ill not be concerned with the print speed or any issues with the output (within reason). It is also notable that for this step I will not have access to 3d printed parts so many of the brackets and connections will need to be made with a combination of particle board, zip ties and assorted hardware.

 - [Testing](https://github.com/SamBaker101/PATT_MK0/blob/main/docs/MK0/MK0_testing.md)  
 - [BOM](https://github.com/SamBaker101/PATT_MK0/blob/main/docs/MK0/MK0_BOM.csv)     

### MK1 - It Prints Itself?

- Goal: Replace all temporary parts with self printed parts, these parts must be reliable, consistant and free of major artifacts.
- Status: In Progress
- Expected Date: 11/30/2025
- Comments: Once MK0 is able to complete prints I will begin replacing the temporary plywood parts with custom designed 3d printed parts. I expect this to be an iterative process as replacing selected parts should increase the overall print quality which would in turn allow me to make better versions of those parts. At this time I will also be adding mechanical belt tensioning systems and a reliable bed leveling mechanism. I will also create an electronics board beneath the print bed and clean up the wire routing.

## MK2 - Use It

- Goal: 
     - Print a Benchy in under 45min with no major quality issues
- Status: Planned
- Expected Date: Open
- Comments: I think it's important here to use the printer for it's intended purpose for few weeks-months building other projects. I am eager to begin work on some new robotics projetcs and to explore the organizational print community so this shouldn't be a struggle. This will give me a better sense of the printers capabilities and it's major pain points.  As I become more familiar with the printer I will revisit the custom parts and look at other enhancements that can be made to improve performance. 

### MK3 - Upgrade$$$

- Goal: 
     - Print Benchy without major errors in PETG, TPE and ABS. 
     - Print in place chainmail in PLA.
     - Print Benchy in PLA in less than 30 min
- Status: Planned
- Expected Date: Start date + 2 months
- Comments: In my initial build I generally went with the lowest cost option to avoid any expensive mistakes, Now is the time to correct that. Upgrade the control board, motor controllers and hot end to competitive versions. At this time I will also add a heated bed and upgrade any of the PLA printed parts as required. By now I can expect to be well aware of any other issues in the build (linear rods, lead screws ect), so I will take care of any of these issues which I've been putting off.

#### MKZ - Next Steps
- Explore alternate configurations (Core XY, Delta 3d ect.)
- Build a vented, temperature controlled (and sound insulating) cabinet
- Add a second extruder
- Build an AMS
- Build a dry box

## Modelling

<img src="./images/full_build.PNG" alt="drawing" width="750"/>

NOTE: These models are approximate versions created while developing the printer design. I am in the process of redesigning a number of the parts and will be updating these assemblies as I solidify their new models.

The model is broken into 3 primary sections, one for each axis. The Y-axis assembly includes the print plate while the X-axis includes the hotend and extruder. Each of these main assemblies is further divided into sub assemblies to isolate different segments such as motor drives, frame segments, ect. 

All models were created using FreeCAD 1.0. FreeCAD can be downloaded at the following link to access or modify the files:

https://www.freecad.org/

### Models

#### Full Frame

<img src="./images/full_frame_05_06.PNG" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

Needs Feet of some kind as the motors will drop beneath the frame by ~20mm. Could assist with leveling and shock absorbtion as well.

#### Y-Axis

<img src="./images/y_axis.PNG" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

#### X-Axis

<img src="./images/x_axis.PNG" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

 - Cart and hot end assembly still required
 - XZ Bracket assemblies need refinement
 - Belt Tensioner missing from left bracket

#### Z-Axis

## Parts

My initial approach to part selection was to minimize cost wherever reasonable. My goal was to build a functional printer without a strong focus on print speed or quality. This was to allow time to develop my own skills and identify any knowledge gaps or incorrect assumptions I have.  

Now that I have created a prototype device, I will begin iterating on the device and replacing those lower cost parts with higher end equipment to improve overall quality.

### Custom Parts

Now that MK0 is complete I am beginning the process of replacing the wood panel parts with 3d printed ones. Additionally there are a number of fairly hackey fixes (tensioners, bed leveling, endstops ect) which need more robust solutions.

As I design these new parts I will place the stl files [here](https://github.com/SamBaker101/PATT_MK0/tree/main/models/custom_parts).

Additionally I will include pictures and short descriptions of each part in this [document](https://github.com/SamBaker101/PATT_MK0/blob/main/models/custom_parts/custom_parts.md).

As I get into replacing the more structural components of the build I will also replace the draft assemblies with new more accurate ones.
