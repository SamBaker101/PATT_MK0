### Bed Leveling Wheel

Simple wheel to sit over bed levelling nuts and make adjustment easier. This is a quick mock-up which I may return to later to refine.

### Adjustment Bolt Sleeves

The spacers I used in the initial build have too large an internal diameter so there is slop in the bed, especially if the level screws are set too high. Additionally they are simple cylinders so the glue joints break easily. This part is meant to correct these issues.

### End Stop Holders

This is a bracket to hold the limit switches. The bracket is designed to allow for minor adjustment of the switch position. This initial version of the bracket is made to work with the current wood panel frame brackets and will need to be revisited as I refine the rest of the frame design. The Z-Axis will require an additional bracket to hold the limit switch out from the frame in the correct position.

### Z Endstop Holder

This holder works in conjunction with the general endstop holder to hold the z limit switch away from the frame. The slots alow fine tuning of the z height.

### Electrical Component Board
### Cable Management Aids
