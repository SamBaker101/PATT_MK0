## Print Bed
### Bed Leveling Wheel

Simple wheel to sit over bed levelling nuts and make adjustment easier. This is a quick mock-up which I may return to later to refine.

### Adjustment Bolt Sleeves

The spacers I used in the initial build have too large an internal diameter so there is slop in the bed, especially if the level screws are set too high. Additionally they are simple cylinders so the glue joints break easily. This part is meant to correct these issues.

### Spool Holder

<img src="images\spool_cap.PNG" alt="drawing" width="250"/>

Spool holder for the top of the printer. I had to go back and add some ribs to strengthen this print. If it is still to week I may try a carriage style design where the post is reenforced on both sides.

### Lower Bed Carrier

## Structural
### Feet

It's a foot! This is meant to stabalize the frame as well as raise the printer to allow room for the electronics board. Comprised of two seperate pieces (Bracket and Base). Rubber blocks will be attached to the base.

One change that I will make in my next iteration of this part ill be to extend the tabs which bolt to the frame. The screw holes on these tabs currently overlap with the lower portion of the foot making tightening the screws challenging.

### Corner Re-enforcements

This is a simple bracket to stabalize the connection between the z axis frame and the lower (y-axis) frame.

## Brackets and Carriages
### Y-Axis Brackets (Front and Back)
### Z-Axis Brackets (Top and Bottom)

Lower bracket is not strong enough. Also center motor hole is two small. Second revision being tested.

### Z Carriages (Left and Right)

<img src="images\z_carriage_left.PNG" alt="drawing" height="250"/>

These carriages are working fairly well. They could use some reenforcement though I did print them with limitted infill/resolution so reprinting may help.

End stop holder should be moved up slightly to give clearance for timing belt. More space should be opened between threaded z-rod attachments to simplify installation.

More space is needed for x axis to pass through body, I had to drill/melt to make space.

### X Carriage

Insufficient space for extruder motor so I've had to use a spacer, support flaps interfering with timing belt need to be repositioned (I snapped them off for now).

## Electrical Components
### End Stop Holders
<img src="images\endstop_bracket.PNG" alt="drawing" width="250"/>

This is a bracket to hold the limit switches. The bracket is designed to allow for minor adjustment of the switch position. This initial version of the bracket is made to work with the current wood panel frame brackets and will need to be revisited as I refine the rest of the frame design. The Z-Axis will require an additional bracket to hold the limit switch out from the frame in the correct position.

### Z Endstop Holder
<img src="images\z_endstop_bracket.PNG" alt="drawing" width="250"/>

This holder works in conjunction with the general endstop holder to hold the z limit switch away from the frame. The slots alow fine tuning of the z height.

### Electrical Component Board
### Cable Management Aids
