# MK1 - Basic Prototype

Note: MK1 is still in progress. At this point I've redesigned the X and Z axis though further refinement is still necessary.

## Background

The primary goal of MK1 is to move from the somewhat hacked together MK0 to a more robust and coherent platform that I can build on for future developements. This primarily involves replacing the wood panel parts with 3d printed ones. The majority of the zip ties should also be removed during this step. In adition I have added an Orange Pi to run an OctoPrint server. Finally I will be making some refinements to the wiring and electrical system.
